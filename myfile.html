      documentation source, and configuration files.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to
      compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media
      types.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright
      notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in
      the Appendix below).<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or
      Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of
      this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable
      from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and
      Derivative Works thereof.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the
      original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work
      or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for

      Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the
      purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot; means any form of
      electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its
      representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic
      mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that
      are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing
      and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously

      a Contribution.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal
      Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br>

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
      License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
      non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
      reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
      sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
      Object form.<br>
      <br>
      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
      License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
      non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
      section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
      and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
      patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed
      by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute
      patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
      in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the
      Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
      licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as
      of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
      <br>
      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
      Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:<br>
      <br>
      You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy
      of this License; and<br>
      You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
      You changed the files; and<br>
      You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
      distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
      the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
      any part of the Derivative Works; and<br>
      If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a
      readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file,
      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative
      Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
      distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a
      display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party
      notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
      informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your
      own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute,
      alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that
      such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the
      License. <br>
      <br>
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
      provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
      reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
      Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
      distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
      this License.<br>
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
      Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
      Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
      additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein
      shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may
      have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
      <br>
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
      required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
      Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
      <br>
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to
      in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
      Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
      CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
      any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
      FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
      the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
      associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
      <br>
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether
      in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
      applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to
      in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
      direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
      character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
      to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
      commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
      the possibility of such damages.<br>
      <br>
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee
      for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
      obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting
      such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
      responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree
      to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
      accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>
      <br>
      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>

        Eclipse Public License - v 1.0<br>
        <br>
        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC<br>
        LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
        THE PROGRAM<br>
        CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br>
        <br>
        1. DEFINITIONS<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Contribution&quot; means:<br>
        <br>
        a) in the case of the initial
        Contributor, the initial code and       <br>
        documentation distributed
        under this Agreement, and       <br>
        b) in the case of each
        subsequent Contributor:       <br>
        <br>
        i) changes to the Program,
        and       <br>
        <br>
        ii) additions to the
        Program;       <br>
        <br>
        where such changes and/or
        additions to the Program originate from and are       <br>
        distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'
        from a<br>
        Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or
        anyone<br>
        acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions
        to<br>
        the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed
        in<br>
        conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii)
        are<br>
        not derivative works of the Program. <br>
        <br>
        &quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the
        Program.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
        which are<br>
        necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or
        when<br>
        combined with the Program.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with
        this Agreement.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this
        Agreement,<br>
        including all Contributors.<br>
        <br>
        2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br>
        <br>
        a) Subject to the terms of this
        Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants       <br>
        Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license
        to<br>
        reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
        perform,<br>
        distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any,
        and<br>
        such derivative works, in source code and object code form.<br>
        <br>
        b) Subject to the terms of this
        Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants       <br>
        Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license
        under<br>
        Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and
        otherwise<br>
        transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code
        and<br>
        object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of
        the<br>
        Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by
        the<br>
        Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to
        be<br>
        covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to
        any<br>
        other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se
        is<br>
        licensed hereunder. <br>
        <br>
        c) Recipient understands that
        although each Contributor grants the       <br>
        licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided
        by<br>
        any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or
        other<br>
        intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor
        disclaims<br>
        any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based
        on<br>
        infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition
        to<br>
        exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
        hereby<br>
        assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property
        rights<br>
        needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required
        to<br>
        allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
        to<br>
        acquire that license before distributing the Program.<br>
        <br>
        d) Each Contributor represents
        that to its knowledge it has sufficient       <br>
        copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
        license<br>
        set forth in this Agreement. <br>
        <br>
        3. REQUIREMENTS<br>
        <br>
        A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
        under<br>
        its own license agreement, provided that:<br>
        <br>
        a) it complies with the terms
        and conditions of this Agreement; and       <br>
        <br>
        b) its license agreement:       <br>
        <br>
        i) effectively disclaims on
        behalf of all Contributors all warranties and       <br>
        conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of
        title<br>
        and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
        merchantability<br>
        and fitness for a particular purpose; <br>
        <br>
        ii) effectively excludes on
        behalf of all Contributors all liability for       <br>
        damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential<br>
        damages, such as lost profits; <br>
        <br>
        iii) states that any provisions
        which differ from this Agreement are       <br>
        offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and<br>
        <br>
        iv) states that source code for
        the Program is available from such       <br>
        Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner
        on<br>
        or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. <br>
        <br>
        When the Program is made available in source code form:<br>
        <br>
        a) it must be made available
        under this Agreement; and       <br>
        <br>
        b) a copy of this Agreement
        must be included with each copy of the       <br>
        Program. <br>
        <br>
        Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within
        the<br>
        Program.<br>
        <br>
        Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
        Contribution, if<br>
        any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify
        the<br>
        originator of the Contribution.<br>
        <br>
        4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br>
        <br>
        Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
        with<br>
        respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license
        is<br>
        intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor
        who<br>
        includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
        manner<br>
        which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
        Therefore, if<br>
        a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
        such<br>
        Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend
        and indemnify<br>
        every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any
        losses, damages<br>
        and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits
        and other legal<br>
        actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to
        the<br>
        extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor
        in<br>
        connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
        product<br>
        offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or
        Losses<br>
        relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In
        order<br>
        to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the
        Commercial<br>
        Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
        Contributor<br>
        to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense
        and<br>
        any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may<br>
        participate in any such claim at its own expense.<br>
        <br>
        For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
        product<br>
        offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If
        that<br>
        Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
        warranties<br>
        related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
        such<br>
        Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section,
        the<br>
        Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other<br>
        Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
        court<br>
        requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
        Commercial<br>
        Contributor must pay those damages.<br>
        <br>
        5. NO WARRANTY<br>
        <br>
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON
        AN<br>
        &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
        EITHER EXPRESS OR<br>
        IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
        TITLE,<br>
        NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
        Each<br>
        Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of
        using<br>
        and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
        exercise<br>
        of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks
        and<br>
        costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss
        of<br>
        data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of
        operations.<br>
        <br>
        6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br>
        <br>
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
        ANY<br>
        CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,<br>
        SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
        LOST<br>
        PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
        CONTRACT,<br>
        STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN
        ANY<br>
        WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY
        RIGHTS<br>
        GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
        DAMAGES.<br>
        <br>
        7. GENERAL<br>
        <br>
        If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
        applicable<br>
        law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
        the<br>
        terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto,
        such<br>
        provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
        such<br>
        provision valid and enforceable.<br>
        <br>
        If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any<br>
        entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
        the<br>
        Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
        or<br>
        hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
        rights<br>
        granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation
        is<br>
        filed.<br>
        <br>
        All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails
        to<br>
        comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and
        does<br>
        not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware
        of<br>
        such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
        terminate,<br>
        Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon
        as<br>
        reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this
        Agreement<br>
        and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
        continue<br>
        and survive.<br>
        <br>
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but
        in<br>
        order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only
        be<br>
        modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right
        to<br>
        publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
        time.<br>
        No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
        Agreement.<br>
        The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse
        Foundation may assign the responsibility to<br>
        serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new
        version<br>
        of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
        Program<br>
        (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version
        of<br>
        the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version
        of<br>
        the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
        Program<br>
        (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly
        stated<br>
        in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses
        to<br>
        the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
        whether<br>
        expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program
        not<br>
        expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.<br>
        <br>
        This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
        the<br>
        intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to
        this<br>
        Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one
        year<br>
        after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury
        trial<br>
        in any resulting litigation. <br>

      Partially supported by University of San Francisco &amp; jGuru.com <br>
      <br>
      We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the <br>
      public domain. An individual or company may do whatever <br>
      they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the <br>
      code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of <br>
      ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software. <br>
      <br>
      We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, <br>
      we do ask that credit is given to us for developing <br>
      ANTLR. By &quot;credit&quot;, we mean that if you use ANTLR or <br>
      incorporate any source code into one of your programs <br>
      (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that <br>
      you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation, <br>
      research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have <br>
      developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that <br>
      you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the <br>
      headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these <br>
      guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this <br>
      system and expect to make other tools available as they are <br>
      completed. <br>
